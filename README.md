InputStutter
============

used to demonstrate iOS input stutter

While the game is running, access the Command Center and Notification Center by swiping from the top and bottom edge of the screen. This either causes the touch input to update at a slower rate than the game is running, or restore the touch input to the same rate as the game is running.
